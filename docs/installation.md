## Python libraries
Whenever possible we strive to use as few Python dependencies as possible, 
and to develop examples using the most common libraries for scientific 
programing in Python. Currently this includes the following:

- Python Data Science:  
    - Numpy: arrays, tensors, and numeric processing.  
    - Pandas: tabular dataframes, statistical processing.  
    - Scipy: statistical distributions.  
    - ...
