# Quick Guide
This tutorial provides a brief walk through of a simple *Traversome* analysis.
For more details on each step of this analysis see the relevant section of 
of the documentation.

### The Dataset
The kakapo genome ...

### Assembly Graph Estimation
For this sample data high depth sequencing data is available in the form of 
both short Illumina paired reads as well as PacBio RSII long reads. The 
former has greater accuracy and depth and is therefore better suited to 
infer an accurate assembly graph representing all contigs in the genome, 
and evidence of connections between them.
