# Assembly Graphs
An assembly graph represents all contigs in a genome assembly
as well as all observed connections between them. Most genome
assembly software will return an assembly graph as a GFA or ...
formatted file. 

### Assembly graph format
An example assembly graph will contain information like the 
following:

```parsed-literal
...

```

### Assembly graph inference
Assembly software tools vary ...

```bash
getOrganelle -x -y -z
```

### Visualizing assembly graphs



### Manual curation
